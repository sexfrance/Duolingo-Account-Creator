  <p align="center">
   This script helps you create Duolingo accounts automatically. It can make three types of accounts: unclaimed (just created), claimed (with email and password), and verified (fully activated). The tool uses proxies, random device settings, and fake emails to look like a real user. It’s fast, works with multiple threads, and saves the account info in neat files.
